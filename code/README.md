# Advent of Code 2025 - Python Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 repository!  
This project contains my solutions to each day's puzzles, written in Python.

## üìÅ Project Structure


- Each **dayXX** folder contains:
  - `input.txt` - Puzzle input
  - `problem.txt` - problem statement
  - `solution.py` - Solution

- Common utilities like file loaders are placed under `utils/`.

## How to Run

To run a day's solution:

```bash
cd 2025/day01
python3 solution.py

pip install -r requirements.txt
